This study aimed to analyze the influence of oil viscosity and fuel quality on the engine performance and pollutant emissions in an internal combustion engine. A Response Surface Methodology (RSM)-based experimental design was employed. Three oil viscosity levels (SAE 5W-30, 10W-30, and 20W-50) and three fuel quality levels (87, 92, and 95 octane) were evaluated using a Chevrolet Grand Vitara 2.0L (General Motors, Quito, Ecuador) tested on a dynamometer. The oil grades were selected to represent a practical range of viscosities commonly used in commercial vehicles operating under local conditions. The results indicate that using lower-viscosity oil (SAE 5W-30) increased the engine power by up to 6.25% compared to when using SAE 20W-50. Additionally, using higher-octane fuel led to an average power increase of 1.49%, attributed to improved combustion stability and the ability to operate at a more advanced ignition timing without knocking. The emissions analysis revealed that high-viscosity oil at high RPMs increased CO2 emissions to 14.4% vol, whereas low-viscosity oil at low RPMs reduced CO2 emissions to 13.4% vol. Statistical analysis confirmed that the engine speed (RPM) was the most influential factor in emissions (F = 163.11 and p < 0.0001 for CO2; F = 247.02 and p < 0.0001 for NOx), while fuel quality also played a significant role. These findings suggest that optimizing the oil viscosity and selecting the appropriate fuel can enhance engine efficiency and reduce emissions, thereby contributing to the development of more sustainable automotive technologies. Future research should explore the use of ultra-low-viscosity lubricants (SAE 0W-20) and assess their long-term effects on engine wear. © 2025 by the authors.","engine performance; engine power; fuel quality; internal combustion engine (ICE); oil viscosity; pollutant emissions; response surface methodology (RSM)","Combustion equipment; Internal combustion engines; Viscosity of gases; Combustion engines; Engine performance; Engine power; Fuel quality; Internal combustion; Internal combustion engine; Oil viscosity; Pollutants emissions; Response surface methodology; Response-surface methodology; Automotive industry","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003543236"

The model efficiently allocates transmission channels, minimizing smart grid (SG) costs. The MVNO manages fixed and random channels through a shared access scheme, optimizing meter connectivity. Channel allocation is based on a Markovian approach and optimized through the Hungarian algorithm that minimizes the weight in a bipartite network between meters and channels. In addition, cumulative tokens are introduced that weight transmissions according to channel availability and network congestion. Simulations show that dynamic allocation in virtual networks improves transmission performance, contributing to sustainability and cost reduction in cellular networks. This study highlights the importance of inefficient resource management by cognitive mobile virtual network and cognitive radio virtual network operators (C-MVNOs), laying a solid foundation for future applications in intelligent networks. This work is motivated by the increasing demand for efficient and scalable data transmission in smart metering systems. The novelty lies in integrating cumulative tokens and a Markovian-based bipartite graph matching algorithm, which jointly optimize channel allocation and transmission reliability under heterogeneous wireless conditions. © 2025 by the authors.","cellular networks; channel allocation; cognitive mobile virtual network operator; congestion management; data transmission; Hungarian algorithm; matching; resource optimization; smart meters; wireless channels","Cellular radio systems; Congestion control (communication); Information management; Markov processes; Resource allocation; Cellular network; Channel allocation; Cognitive mobile virtual network operator; Congestions managements; Data-transmission; Hungarian algorithm; Matchings; Mobile virtual network operator; Resources optimization; Wireless channel; algorithm; article; cognition; controlled study; human; operator; radio; reliability; simulation; Smart meters","Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS; Salesian Institutions of Higher Education; IUS","Funding text 1: The Salesian Polytechnic University and GIREI supported this work through the Smart Grids Research Group under the Information and Communication Technologies for Education Considering Educational Engineering project.; Funding text 2: This work was funded by the Smart Grids Research Group (GIREI) and the Telecommunications and Telematics Research Group (GITEL) of the Salesian Polytechnic University, the Electricity Networks and Smart Cities (RECI), and the Salesian Institutions of Higher Education (IUS).

By proposing a reduction in voltage at the nodes of the electrical system, it is possible to minimize voltage variation in the system using mixed integer nonlinear programming. The proposed methodology was tested on the IEEE 30-bus test system, where the objective function was modeled and simulated independently to test the results achieved through an AC OPF and reducing energy loss in the system.

The objective of this research was to inventory, characterize, and assess the diversity of microalgae in the Quimsacocha lake system in Azuay, Ecuador. Water samples were collected from the two most important Quimsacocha lakes to morphologically characterize the microalgae and evaluate their diversity. The diversity and physicochemical parameters were measured to evaluate and explain differences in community richness and composition using multivariate analysis (NMDS and PERMANOVA). The level of organic pollution in the lakes was estimated using the Pollution Index, and the trophic status was assessed using dominant phytoplankton (AARL-PP Score). Eighty morphospecies were identified within 25 genera, 16 families and 8 classes. The Bacillariophyceae class was the most diverse, represented by five families. The genera Synedra, Chlorella, and Cosmarium were the most abundant, suggesting a moderate level of organic pollution and a mesotrophic state in the lakes. Physicochemical parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity were similar in both lakes. Nonetheless, the lake depth was different, varying between 0.9 and 8 m in LQA (with one extreme value of 22 m), compared to LQB, which had depths between 7 and 19 m. Alpha diversity revealed a significant difference (p = 0.0001) in species abundance between the two lakes, while specific richness was similar (p = 0.8213). In terms of beta diversity, a significant difference in species composition was observed (p = 0.001).

Optimal transmission switching (OTS) allows various types of analysis to be carried out; the loadability of the lines, response times, and operating costs, among other aspects, can be improved. This article proposes minimizing the losses in the transmission lines with OTS by using AC power flows as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem (MINLP). Several test scenarios evaluate the method’s effectiveness, determining the optimal topology for corrective control that optimizes power flows in different situations. It is proven that this approach reduces losses compared to a base case by 99%, even in the face of N − 1 or random contingencies, without losing the load and while maintaining the same active power dispatch and, finally, verifying a strategic increase in the dispatch of reactive power to maintain operating parameters within stable limits. © 2025 by the authors.","loss minimization; optimal power flow-AC; optimal transmission switching; power losses; power system planning","DC power transmission; Electric load flow; Electric load management; Electric power system stability; Electric power transmission networks; Integer programming; Power transmission lines; Reconfigurable architectures; Losses minimizations; Optimal power flow-AC; Optimal power flows; Optimal transmission; Optimal transmission switching; Power systems planning; Powerloss; Transmission switching; Transmission-line; Electric power system planning","Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS; Integration of Artificial Intelligence in the Planning, Operation, (083-02-2024-04-12)","This work was supported by Salesian Polytechnic University and GIREI-Smart Grid Research Group under the project \u201CIntegration of Artificial Intelligence in the Planning, Operation, and Protection of Electrical Power Systems\u201D, Resolution No.: 083-02-2024-04-12.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003694432"

However, this emerging technology brings with it a series of challenges, such as biases, lack of transparency in algorithms, and concerns over data privacy and security, making it imperative to adopt a new, responsible ethical framework in addressing these issues. In this regard, the objective of this research is to analyze ethics and artificial intelligence within organizations by examining the contributions of philosophers such as Gadamer, Habermas, and Cortina, among others, who offer reflective proposals for tackling ethical implications in the organizational sphere. The methodology employed is philosophical hermeneutics, aimed at interpreting and understanding collected texts and data. It is concluded that while AI is a valuable tool for optimizing processes and reducing costs, it also presents risks that, if not managed properly, could negatively impact human well-being and organizational integrity. Therefore, it is essential to develop an ethics that transcends conventional boundaries and is enriched by approaches such as discourse theory, interdisciplinary dialogue, and interculturality. © 2025, Ediciones Clio.

Researchers striving for full autonomy have employed a variety of sensors, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), cameras, inertial measurement units (IMU), and GPS, along with developing intelligent algorithms for their effective application. In addition to these advancements, the creation of high-precision maps has gained significant attention. These maps play a crucial role in localization using point clouds and in detailing the operational environment by generating routes and identifying traffic elements. As a result, they have become critical components of autonomous driving systems. This paper explores a modern method for map generation specifically oriented towards autonomous driving and examines its evolution through simulations conducted on the Autoware software platform.

Three-dimensional printing has emerged as a viable alternative for very low production volumes, offering properties comparable to traditional methods at significantly reduced costs. To assess the tensile strength, specimens printed with identical geometric parameters to the 3D-printed containers were tested according to ASTM D638 standards, enabling the determination of the stress–strain curve behavior. A compression test was conducted on containers obtained from both manufacturing processes to establish their respective resistance and deformation characteristics. The results revealed a 67% difference in resistance, indicating greater rigidity in the 3D-printed container, and a higher deformation in the blow-molded container, reaching up to 4 mm in height without fracture. Similarly, impact resistance was analyzed using finite element analysis with Ls-Dyna software, showing deformation differences of 0.91% and stress differences of 2.15%.

This study aimed to evaluate this variation by analyzing EEG signals from 17 healthy subjects during an L2 learning process without stimulation and under three binaural stimulations at 9 and 18 Hz. Specifically, we transformed the signals to the frequency domain and segmented the total time of a class into time intervals of Δt=20 s, calculating the maximum frequency and amplitude per interval. The EEG recording under stimulation showed significant frequency variation, mainly under 9 Hz sonata and 9 Hz tone binaural stimulation. The frequency shift from the beta to the alpha band was primarily achieved with the 9 Hz tone stimulation. The amplitude of the maximum recorded frequency decreased with almost all stimulations. These findings provide evidence for selective modulation of brain activity to different auditory stimuli, such as the frontal and occipital cortex, in attention and visual processing during L2 learning.

In laboratory conditions, the tooth breakage of a pinion with different severity levels was simulated in a spur gearbox. Four accelerometers were installed in the gearbox in a vertical position to obtain the vibration signal. First, information was extracted from the vibration signal through 25 CIs in the accelerometers. Using artificial intelligence, the ranking of 10 CIs was carried out. Subsequently, the random forest (RF) algorithm was used to determine the accuracy in classifying the failure severity level. Finally, an ANOVA test was conducted to determine if there were significant differences in classification accuracy for the four accelerometers.

In this work, Monte Carlo methods were used to estimate the gamma-ray spectra produced when 252Cf and DT (14.1 MeV) neutrons interact with 12.70 and 20.32 cm-diameter spheres made with methamphetamines, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. Pulse height spectra show 2.22, 4.44, 5.11, and 6.13 MeV photopeaks induced in 1H, 12C, 14N, and 16O. Narcotics are compounds with H, C, N, and O, and the area under the induced gamma rays 1Hγ (2.22 MeV), 12Cγ (4.44 MeV), 14Nγ (5.11 MeV) and 16Oγ (6.13 MeV) were calculated. The 1Hγ/12Cγ, 1Hγ/14Nγ, 12Cγ/14Nγ, 1Hγ/16Oγ and 12Cγ/16Oγ gamma-ray ratios were calculated aiming to distinguish the narcotic. In addition, the linear attenuation coefficients, the effective atomic numbers, and the macroscopic fast neutron removal cross section were calculated.

This means that one must view efficiency from the perspective of groups of DMUs rather than from the perspective of the individual DMU. Second, two stage problems can, in the presence of shared factors, result in different groupings of DMUs in one stage than in another. Third, in certain circumstances efficiency can be viewed from the perspective of multiple attributes (e.g. different types of tourism).

In this work, the effect of using radiomic information extracted from CESM studies (images obtained from both low-energy (LM) and recombined (CM), respectively) is evaluated. The proposed strategy fuses radiomic texture features extracted from a selected region of interest (ROI) in both the LM (low-energy ROI) and recombined ROI (CM), respectively. These features are then combined into a single, representative feature vector integrating the information from both ROIs, considered as complementary images. The relevant features are selected by using a Principal Component analysis (PCA). Hence two radiomic information fusion approaches were evaluated, in the first, the extracted features from each ROI were assembled in a single vector and then reduced. In the second approach, the extracted features were first reduced and then combined. Finally, the resulting feature vector is used as input for a binary classifier implemented with a support vector machine (SVM) for classifying breast masses as benign or malignant. The obtained results demonstrated that the combined data effectively represent mammographic mass features, enabling automated differentiation between benign and malignant.

This study proposes a methodology based on data analytics that, through the processing of information, generates lists of suspicious metering systems for fraud. The database provided by the electrical distribution company contains 266,298 records, of which 15,013 have observations for possible frauds. One of the challenges lies in managing the different variables in the training data and choosing appropriate evaluation metrics. To address this, a balanced database of 27,374 records was used, with an equitable division between fraud and non-fraud cases. The features used in the identification and construction of patterns for non-technical losses were crucial, although additional techniques could be applied to determine the most relevant variables. Following the process, several popular classification models were trained. Hyperparameter optimization was performed by using grid search, and the models were validated by using cross-validation techniques, finding that the ensemble methods Categorical Boosting (CGB), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGB) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (EGB) are the most suitable for identifying losses, achieving high performance and reasonable computational cost. The best performance was compared by measuring accuracy (Acc) and F1 score, which allows for the evaluation of various techniques and is a combination of two metrics: detection rate and precision. Although CGB achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy (Acc = 0.897) and F1 (0.894), it was slower than LGB, so it is considered the ideal classifier for the data provided by the electrical distribution company. This research study highlights the importance of the techniques used for fraud detection in electricity metering systems, although the results may vary depending on the characteristics of the training, the number of variables, and the available hardware resources. © 2025 by the authors.","data analytics; energy measurement; machine learning; non-technical electrical losses; utility","Data Analytics; Metadata; Steganography; Data analytics; Electrical loss; Energy; Gradient boosting; Machine-learning; Metering systems; Non-technical electrical loss; Non-technical loss; Performance; Utility; Adaptive boosting","Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MCIN, (TED2021-131097B-I00)","This work was carried out thanks to the support of Salesian Polytechnic University and the Energy Transition Research Group of said university.

The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between personal history of communicable, i.e., infectious and parasitic diseases and self-rated health. Study design: Secondary analysis of a large dataset multi-country observational study. Methods: We used a four-pronged analysis approach to investigate whether personal history of infectious and parasitic diseases is related to self-reported health, measured with a single item. Results: Three of the four analyses found a small positive effect on self-reported health among those reporting a history of pathogen exposure. The meta-analysis found no support but large heterogeneity that was not reduced by two classifications of countries. Conclusion: Personal history of infectious and parasitic diseases does not reduce self-reported health across a global sample. © 2025 The Authors","Communicable diseases; Global health; Mental health; Multiverse analysis","Adult; Communicable Diseases; Female; Global Health; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parasitic Diseases; Quality of Life; Self Report; mental health; meta-analysis; parasitic disease; pathogen; public health; quality of life; Article; dispersity; economic aspect; global health; health; history; infection; Likert scale; parasitosis; prediction; prevalence; propensity score; questionnaire; secondary analysis; self reported health; sensitivity analysis; adult; communicable disease; epidemiology; female; health status; human; male; middle aged; quality of life; self report","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001208443"

The proposed methodology seeks to maximize restored load, considering operational constraints such as line loadability, voltage limits, and radial topology preservation. It is evaluated with simulations on the IEEE 34-bus test system under four contingency scenarios that consider the disconnection of specific branches. The algorithm’s ability to restore service is demonstrated by identifying optimal auxiliary line reconnections. The method maximizes restored load, achieving between 97% and 99% load reconnection, with an average of 98.8% across the four cases analyzed. Bus voltages remain above 0.95 pu and below the upper limit. Furthermore, test feeder results demonstrate that line loadability is mostly below 60% of the post-reconfiguration loadability. © 2025 by the authors.","contingency analysis; distribution system reconfiguration; genetic algorithms; load margin; resilient power systems","Auxiliary power systems; Electric loads; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission; Electric power utilization; Power system analysis; Contingency analysis; Distribution system reconfiguration; Distribution systems; Electrical services; Line loadability; Load margin; Operational constraints; Power; Resilient power system; Voltage limits; Genetic algorithms","Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS","This research and APC were funded by the Salesian Polytechnic University and the GIREI\u2014Smart Grid Research Group.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007730035"

However, successful implementation requires strong public policies, including tax incentives and educational programs, to encourage widespread adoption. This study identifies the optimal electric bus model for Cuenca, Ecuador, using the multicriteria decision-making methods PROMETHEE and TOPSIS. The evaluation considers four key dimensions: technical (autonomy, passenger capacity, charging time, engine power), economic (acquisition, operation, and maintenance costs), social (community acceptance and accessibility), and environmental (reduction of pollutant emissions). The results highlight passenger capacity as the most influential criterion, followed by autonomy and engine power. The selected electric bus model emerges as the most suitable option due to its energy efficiency, low maintenance costs, and long service life, making it a cost-effective long-term investment. Additionally, its adoption would enhance air quality and improve the overall user experience. Beyond its relevance to Cuenca, this study provides a replicable methodology for evaluating electric bus feasibility in other cities with different geographic and socioeconomic contexts. © 2025 by the authors.","electric buses; multicriteria techniques; PROMETHEE; TOPSIS","Bus transportation; Decision making; Energy policy; Mass transportation; Comparative analyzes; Electric bus; Engine power; Multicriteria decision making methods; Multicriteria techniques; Passenger capacity; PROMETHEE; Sustainable transport; TOPSIS; Transport modes; Air quality","Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS; Universidad de Cuenca; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (TED2021-131097B-I00); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN","This work was carried out thanks to the support of the Salesian Polytechnic University and the Energy Transition Research Group of said university, and with the support of the Research Vicerectorate of the University of Cuenca and the VirtualTech Group of the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism of the University of Cuenca.

However, this trend has not been significantly reflected in undergraduate degree works in communication. Methodology: Descriptive research was conducted on the degree works of undergraduate students in Communication at the Salesian Polytechnic University (UPS) in Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca between 2016 and 2021. A total of 427 academic articles published in the university repository were analyzed. Results: The study reveals that Quito leads in the amount of research, with 49.56%, followed by Guayaquil with 30.44%, and Cuenca with 20%. Discussion: The degree works analyzed reflect a predominant focus on media communication and new media, with a particular emphasis on the analysis of the message and the influence of the Internet and social networks. The differences between cities such as Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca reveal preferences towards specific topics such as critical discourse analysis and cultural industries, influenced by the local media and cultural environment. © 2025, HISIN (History of Information Systems).

In addition, new data classes may emerge, a phenomenon known as concept evolution, which represents a growing challenge in many real-world applications. Most current approaches focus on changes in data but lack efficient mechanisms to handle new classes. An additional problem is the availability of labeled data, as many algorithms assume that labels will be continuously available, which is unrealistic. Furthermore, many methods rely on user-defined parameters, which can affect performance.

Andalusia, a region with high renewable potential but strong fossil fuel dependence, presents an opportunity to assess regional energy transitions with broader implications for similar contexts. This study employs the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) to model Andalusia's energy metabolism and evaluate different energy transition scenarios for 2030 and 2050, focusing on GHG emissions, energy demand, and renewable energy integration. Three scenarios are analysed: (1) a baseline scenario, reflecting current policies; (2) an efficiency scenario, incorporating ambitious energy-saving measures; and (3) a long-term scenario, targeting climate neutrality. Results show that renewable energy penetration reaches 33.5% by 2030, failing to meet the 42% target, and reductions in primary energy demand and emissions are insufficient to comply with 2050 climate commitments. While energy efficiency and renewables contribute to emission reductions, additional measures such as greater electrification, faster renewable deployment, and enhanced energy storage are required. These findings highlight the need for stronger policy actions to accelerate decarbonisation, ensuring alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement. This study provides a replicable framework for regional energy planning, offering insights to policymakers to bridge the gap between current trajectories and climate objectives through targeted strategies and infrastructure investments. © 2025 The Authors","Energy-foresight; LEAP; Planning; Scenarios; Sustainability","Clean energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Andalusia; Emission analysis; Energy; Energy transitions; Energy-foresight; Greenhouse gas emissions; Low emission; Low emission analyze platform; Renewables; Scenario; Low emission","Universidad de Huelva, UHU; Andalusian energy system and energy foresight 2050; Center for Andalusian Studies Analysis of energy; Long-Term Energy Alternatives Planning System; Universidad de Jaén, UJA, (12/01/2022, TED2021-131097B-I00, ECO_DIG_2021, 05/01/23, €80,500, PRY079/22, METURBAN 2030, 04/18/23, 11/30/2024, 2022/00407/001); Universidad de Jaén, UJA","The University of Ja\u00E9n has carried out this study, conducted by a multidisciplinary team of researchers specializing in the ecological energy transition, through the research group \u201CTEP-985: R&D in ENGINEERING, ENERGY AND SUSTAINABILITY (GIDIES)\u201D, whose principal investigator is Julio Terrados Cepeda.

This study presents the development and implementation of a real-time emotion recognition system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze students’ facial expressions during in-person classes. Trained on the FER2013 dataset, the system classifies seven distinct emotions with 85% accuracy. An experiment with 20 university students aged 18–25 compared emotional responses across three teaching methodologies: collective, group, and experiential. Experiential teaching elicited the most positive emotions, with 50% of expressions classified as happiness, while collective teaching generated more negative responses. Statistical analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between happiness and academic performance (r = 0.65, p < 0.01) and a negative correlation between fear and performance (r = −0.54, p < 0.05). The system provides educators with quantitative emotional data, enabling real-time adaptation of teaching strategies and retrospective analysis of class dynamics.

This study assessed the association between parental KAP and the prevalence and severity of caries in children aged 5–9 years in Cayambe, Ecuador. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 229 schoolchildren and their caregivers, using a validated questionnaire and clinical examinations (ICDAS criteria). Caries severity was categorized as “obvious decay” (ICDAS 4–6) or “no obvious decay” (ICDAS 0–3). Results: Advanced dental caries affected 73.4% of children (ICDAS 4–6). While parental knowledge and attitudes showed no significant association, brushing teeth ≥2 times/day significantly reduced caries severity (p < 0.05). Sociodemographic factors, such as parental education, were not significant predictors. Conclusion: Oral hygiene practices—particularly frequent toothbrushing—were the key protective factor against severe caries, highlighting the need for behavior-focused interventions promoting daily habits.

A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm was used to identify a set of optimal parameters that satisfactorily characterize the system’s dynamics. The proposed methodology offers a designer valuable information about the dynamics of the temperatures of the Peltier’s hot and cold surfaces and the trade-offs between their design objectives (visualized in the Pareto fronts). In this way, a control engineer can be sufficiently informed to choose, according to their preferences, a model for the Peltier cell with the best performance (for different system operation scenarios). A Peltier cold-side temperature model was selected to tune a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and evaluate the robustness of the model. The tuned PID controller works directly on the nonlinear model of the Peltier cell, allowing it to effectively control the temperature of the cold surface of the thermoelectric module. The methodology uses the Integral Absolute Error (IAE) as a performance index to evaluate the quality of system modeling. The results show that the methodological approach applied to model and control the system performs very satisfactorily. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm; Multi-objective optimization; Nonlinear model; Pareto front; Peltier cell; PID control","Multiobjective optimization; Nonlinear programming; Nonlinear systems; Pareto principle; Proportional control systems; Robustness (control systems); Structural dynamics; Two term control systems; Cold surface; Modelling and controls; Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm; Multi-objectives optimization; Non-linear modelling; Pareto front; Peltier; Peltier cell; Proportional integral derivative control; Thermoelectric systems; Three term control systems","Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS, (0138-007-2023-12-12); Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS","The authors thank to the Research Group In Control Systems and Robotics (GISCOR).

However, acquiring multiple modalities of electrophysiological data often necessitates the use of diverse, specialized technological tools, which can complicate the establishment of a comprehensive multimodal experimental setup. This paper introduces a prototype system, named the Multimodal–Multichannel Acquisition Module—MADQ, designed for the simultaneous acquisition of multimodal and multichannel electrophysiological and general-purpose signals. The MADQ comprises three distinct capturing blocks, each equipped with separate reference circuits, supporting a total of up to 40 electrophysiological input channels, alongside 4 channels of analog input and 4 channels of digital input signal. The system is capable of sampling frequencies up to 16 kHz. Key features of the MADQ include individually configurable bipolar recording, lead-off detection capability, and real-time online filtering. The system’s functional performance was characterized through metrics such as Input-Referred Noise (IRN), Noise-Free Bits (NFB), and Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) across varying gain and sampling frequencies. Preliminary experiments, conducted in a setup emulating a sleep study with auditory evoked potential detection, demonstrate the system’s potential for integration into multimodal experimental scenarios. © 2025 by the authors.","ADS1299; multichannel biomedical signal acquisition system; multimodal physiological signals","Brain; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiological Phenomena; Evoked Potentials, Auditory; Humans; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Sleep; Blood pressure; Blood vessels; Bone; Brain; Cartilage; Creatinine; Digestive system; Joints (anatomy); Ligaments; Liver; Neurons; Sensory perception; Sleep research; Tendons; Acquisition systems; Ads1299; Biomedical signal acquisition; Capture system; Multi channel; Multi-modal; Multichannel biomedical signal acquisition system; Multimodal physiological signal; Physiological signals; Sampling frequencies; auditory evoked potential; brain; electroencephalography; electrophysiology; human; physiology; procedures; signal processing; sleep; Heart","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq; Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos, FINEP, (01.24.0122.00); Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos, FINEP; Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, FAPERJ, (E-26/204.393/2024); Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, FAPERJ; Polytechnic Salesian University of Ecuador, (048-002-2024-05-21)","This research was supported by funding from Brazilian institutions CNPq, FINEP (process No 01.24.0122.00), and FAPERJ (process No E-26/204.393/2024), as well as the research founding from the Polytechnic Salesian University of Ecuador (Process No 048-002-2024-05-21).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004885648"

The simulations considered a list of 20 to 100 orders or carts with a capacity of 30 to 75 order items. As a result, ANOVA analysis demonstrates the significance of order batching and picking algorithms, number of orders and cart capacity. The order batching algorithms that provide minimum distances in these experiments are G03 and RANDOM, and for order picking, LGAP algorithm is most effective.

A quantitative approach was employed, utilizing a structured survey administered to 384 students to assess their level of financial knowledge and saving practices. The study applied correlational analysis, revealing a moderate positive relationship (Pearson coefficient = 0.518, p < 0.01) between financial education and saving behavior. Findings indicate that although 69% of students have received financial education, only 50% regularly create a personal budget, highlighting gaps in financial planning. Moreover, 69% of respondents consider financial education crucial in university curricula. The study concludes that financial education significantly influences saving habits, but its effectiveness depends on external factors such as access to financial products and economic conditions.

It is considered a multipurpose species due to its environmental benefits, contributing to the restoration of degraded soils and containing active compounds intended for various industries. Consequently, this study aimed to evaluate the viability, germination and in vitro growth of C. spinosa from seeds in different phenological stages. The development of this research was carried out in parts. First, for the viability study, seeds were classified as immature, mature and overripe, from which embryos were extracted and placed in a 1% tetrazolium salt aqueous solution for 5 hours. Second, the water content in the seeds was determined using thermogravimetric analysis to classify the seeds. Third, the seeds were disinfected with Tween 20 for 10 minutes, 70% EtOH for 1 minute and 1.5% NaClO for 10 minutes. Then, germination pre-treatment was performed with a cut in the distal region of the cotyledon (CT) and removal of the seed coat (ST) and they were cultivated in a basal MS medium supplemented with Gamborg vitamins. The highest viability was observed in immature seeds (SI) and mature seeds (SM), with values of 97.72% and 73.45% and corresponding water content of 52.23% and 7.60%, respectively. Regarding germination, the SI-ST treatment achieved a germination speed of 48.55% at 4 days, while in the interaction of phenological state and scarification, the SI-ST treatment achieved the highest percentage at 93.16%. In terms of growth, the treatments showed no statistically significant differences, with values between 52.26 mm and 64.79 mm. These results indicate that the phenological state of the seeds and the type of scarification are important for obtaining quality seedlings in vitro in a shorter time, which can be used in future reforestation and ecosystem restoration programmes. © Mancheno Cárdenas M et al.","Fabaceae; in vitro cultivation; in vitro seedlings; Tara","","Vice-Rectorate of Research at Politécnica Salesiana University; Rufford Foundation; Jima Ltda Community Development Cooperative; Tambillo Forestry Initiative","The authors of this research express their gratitude to the Vice-Rectorate of Research at Polit\u00E9cnica Salesiana University, the Research and Biodiversity Assessment Group (GIVABI), the Rufford Foundation, the Jima Ltda Community Development Cooperative and the Tambillo Forestry Initiative for their support and collaboration, which were instrumental in the successful development of this study.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008303091"

This study determined the levels of chloroform (CHCl3) in drinking water in Cuenca, Ecuador, a topic that has been little explored in the region. During five months, water samples were collected from three water treatment systems (Cebollar, Tixan, and Sustag), and in situ measurements of physicochemical parameters such as free chlorine, pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, and turbidity were performed in the storage and distribution area. The determination of CHCl3 was performed following the Hach protocol. For data analysis, the Kruskal–Wallis test was employed, followed by Dunn’s post hoc method and Spearman’s correlation coefficient. The results revealed a progressive decrease in free residual chlorine throughout the distribution systems. CHCl3 concentrations ranged from 11.75 µg/L to 21.88 µg/L, remaining below the Ecuadorian regulatory limit of 300 µg/L. There was no consistent correlation between CHCl3 and physicochemical parameters. These findings align with previous research, suggesting that the variability in CHCl3 formation is associated with different water treatment conditions and environmental variables. This study highlights the importance of monitoring disinfection processes to minimize THMs and other DBPs, ensure public health, and contribute to sustainable drinking water management in Ecuador. © 2025 by the authors.","chlorination; chloroform; Cuenca; disinfection by-products; drinking water quality; trihalomethanes; water treatment systems","Azuay; Cuenca [Azuay]; Ecuador; Chlorination; Disinfection; Cuencum; Disinfection by-product; Disinfection byproducts; Drinking water supplies; Drinking-water qualities; Ecuador; Physico - chemical parameters; Trihalomethanes; Water chlorination; Water treatment systems; chlorination; chloroform; drinking water; organic compound; public health; water management; water supply; water treatment; Chlorine compounds","Universidad de Cuenca; Université Laval, UL; Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS, (006-001-2024-01-18); Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS","The authors would like to thank the following institutions for funding the project on the detection of trihalomethanes in water: the VIUC of the University of Cuenca, the Salesian Polytechnic University for the approval of project 006-001-2024-01-18, Research on Drinking water of Universit\u00E9 Laval for support in logistics, in particular Cristian Garc\u00EDa for field and laboratory help, and ETAPA EP for the facilities provided during the sampling process.

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a widely used approach, traditionally employing mercury vapor lamps. However, these lamps have efficiency limitations and contain hazardous materials. As an alternative, ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) have emerged as a safer and more sustainable option. Despite their advantages, research on their efficacy against fungal spores remains limited. This study investigates the inactivation and post-exposure response of Aspergillus niger and Penicillium sp. spores using a collimated UV-LED system. The impact of two different wavelengths (265 nm and 280 nm) and post-treatment conditions (light and darkness for 24 h) on fungal viability was analyzed. Kinetic modeling was applied to assess the resistance of the spores and their capacity for photoreactivation. The results demonstrate that both the UV wavelength and the environmental conditions after exposure significantly influence disinfection outcomes. Penicillium sp. exhibited greater susceptibility to UV radiation but also higher photoreactivation potential, while A. niger showed stronger resistance and lower recovery capacity. The UV dose required for 99% inactivation, considering photoreactivation effects, was 323.7 ± 90.0 mJ cm−2 and 321.9 ± 43.8 mJ cm−2 for A. niger, whereas for Penicillium sp., it was 167.7 ± 13.0 mJ cm−2 and 146.5 ± 29.2 mJ cm−2 at 265 nm and 280 nm, respectively. These findings emphasize the necessity of tailoring UV-LED disinfection strategies based on the specific characteristics of the target organisms and post-treatment environmental factors. © 2025 by the authors.","Aspergillus niger; collimated UV system; fungal spores; Penicilliumsp; photoreactivation; UV-LED disinfection","Aspergillus; Laser beams; Aspergillus niger; Collimated ultraviolet system; Fungal spores; Niger; Penicillium sp; Penicilliumsp; Photoreactivation; Post treatment; Ultraviolet LED; Ultraviolet-LED disinfection; disinfection; environmental factor; fungal disease; pesticide by target organism; sporulation; ultraviolet radiation; waterborne disease; Mercury vapor lamps","Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS, (010-005-2021-07-01); Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS","This research was supported by the Salesian Polytechnic University research funds under project number 010-005-2021-07-01.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002557818"

Although numerous indicators can be extracted from vibration signals, selecting the most relevant ones remains challenging. This study proposes a methodology for selecting time-domain features to classify fault severity levels in spur gearboxes. Vibration signals are acquired using six accelerometers and processed to extract 64 statistical condition indicators (CIs). The most informative subset of CIs is identified and selected through a wrapper-based selection approach and artificial intelligence tools. The selected features are then evaluated based on the classification accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) achieved using Random Forest (RF) and K-nearest neighbours (K-NN) models, with performance exceeding 98%. Additionally, the effect of sensor position and inclination on signal quality and classification performance is analysed using factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparison tests. The results confirm the robustness of the selected CIs and the minimal influence of sensor placement variability, supporting the practical applicability of the proposed approach in industrial settings. The methodology offers a structured framework for selecting condition indicators in vibration signals, experimentally validated using multiple sensors and fault severity levels, and it is both automated and straightforward to implement. © 2025 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; classification models; fault severity; feature selection; gearbox fault diagnosis; machine learning; monitoring condition","Gears; Classification models; Condition; Condition indicators; Fault severities; Faults diagnosis; Features selection; Gearbox fault diagnose; Machine-learning; Time domain; Vibration signal; k-nearest neighbors","Universitat Politècnica de València; Grupo de Investigación y Desarrollo en Tecnologías Industriales; GIDTEC; Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS","Funding text 1: Universitat Polit\u00E8cnica de Val\u00E8ncia and Universidad Polit\u00E9cnica Salesiana for funding the research project: \u201CEvaluaci\u00F3n de la severidad de fallos en engranajes rectos y helicoidales mediante se\u00F1ales de vibraci\u00F3n, corriente y emisi\u00F3n ac\u00FAstica\u201D of the \u201CGrupo de Investigaci\u00F3n y Desarrollo en Tecnolog\u00EDas Industriales (GIDTEC)\u201D. ; Funding text 2: Universidad Polit\u00E9cnica Salesiana and Universitat Polit\u00E8cnica de Val\u00E8ncia.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007738432"

This study proposes an automatic real-time fault detection and diagnosis system. It classifies events as either faulty or normal by analyzing key status signals such as pressure, temperature, current, and voltage. This research is based on data-driven models and machine learning, where a specific strategy is proposed for five types of system failures. The work was carried out on a Rittal PAC, model SK3328.500 (cooling unit), installing capacitive pressure sensors, Hall effect current sensors, electromagnetic induction voltage sensors, infrared temperature sensors, and thermocouple-type sensors. For the implementation of the system, a dataset of PAC status signals was obtained, initially consisting of 31,057 samples after a preprocessing step using the Random Under-Sampler (RUS) module. A database with 20,000 samples was obtained, which includes normal and failed operating events generated in the PAC. The selection of the models is based on accuracy criteria, evaluated by testing in both offline (database) and real-time conditions.

Recent advancements in artificial vision systems, driven by deep learning and image processing techniques, offer promising avenues for detecting mobility aids and monitoring gait or posture anomalies. This paper presents a systematic review conducted in accordance with ProKnow-C guidelines, examining key methodologies, datasets, and ethical considerations in mobility impairment detection from 2015 to 2025. Our analysis reveals that convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches, such as YOLO and Faster R-CNN, frequently outperform traditional computer vision methods in accuracy and real-time efficiency, though their success depends on the availability of large, high-quality datasets that capture real-world variability. While synthetic data generation helps mitigate dataset limitations, models trained predominantly on simulated images often exhibit reduced performance in uncontrolled environments due to the domain gap. Moreover, ethical and privacy concerns related to the handling of sensitive visual data remain insufficiently addressed, highlighting the need for robust privacy safeguards, transparent data governance, and effective bias mitigation protocols. Overall, this review emphasizes the potential of artificial vision systems to transform assistive technologies for mobility impairments and calls for multidisciplinary efforts to ensure these systems are technically robust, ethically sound, and widely adoptable. © 2025 by the authors.","assistive computer vision; deep learning; diffusion models; domain adaptation; edge-cloud architecture; mobility impairment detection; privacy-by-design; synthetic data","Convolutional neural networks; Data integration; Data privacy; Data reduction; Large datasets; Photointerpretation; Sorting; Assistive; Assistive computer vision; Cloud architectures; Deep learning; Diffusion model; Domain adaptation; Edge clouds; Edge-cloud architecture; Mobility impairment detection; Synthetic data; Ethical technology","MAI-DAI; Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (310079/2019-5, CNPq/MAI-DAI CP No. 12/2020); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","Funding text 1: We acknowledge the institutional and logistical support provided by the Universidad Polit\u00E9cnica Salesiana (UPS), Ecuador.

In this scenario, Ecuador promotes education on healthy eating through informative materials and talks. However, their content is usually extensive and does not consider the age, economic status, and educational level of the receivers. In addition, children and adolescents often show little interest in learning about healthy eating. In this regard, the literature points to the use of educational games as an effective alternative to improve attention in learning; however, there are few tools addressed to populations in situations of economic and educational vulnerability. This article presents the development and evaluation of an educational game designed to promote learning about healthy eating for children and adolescents in situations of economic and educational vulnerability in Ecuador. The Design Thinking methodology was applied, with three iterative cycles of design, prototyping, and evaluation. Also, a comparative experiment involving 34 participants was conducted to evaluate the observed differences in knowledge acquisition between Nutriacción+ and informative talks. The results analyze how Nutriacción+ contributes to the learning of healthy eating and offer a replicable game design process for similar populations. The results suggest that Nutriacción+ can improve healthy eating knowledge in children aged 8 to 11 years. © 2025 by the authors.","economic vulnerability; educational vulnerability; healthy eating; improve healthy eating knowledge; iterative cycles; replicable game design process","","Salesian Polytechnic University of Equator; Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS, (025-002-2024-02-29); Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS","Funding text 1: We extend our thanks to architect Edgar Gordillo, former director of the Salesian Foundation PACES, for facilitating the co-design sessions for the prototypes.

The proposed approach includes a statistical framework based on confidence intervals to classify data as typical or atypical, thereby facilitating the selection of the most appropriate clustering technique based on the characteristics of the dataset. To evaluate the methodology, an analysis of probability distributions is used, comparing it with three internal validation techniques through the implementation of specific criteria. These metrics provide insight into the dispersion and distribution of the EDPs, allowing for a robust evaluation of how variations in data impact clustering outcomes. The results indicate that the SOM, FCM and HC techniques exhibit strong adaptability to different patterns of variability, making them suitable for diverse applications in energy management.

Latin America, characterized by its rich biodiversity and dependence on natural resources, confronts urgent challenges posed by climate change. The region’s vulnerabilities are further aggravated by extreme weather events, deforestation, and shifts in precipitation patterns, directly threatening ecosystems, public health, and local economies. The LDA model identifies critical themes, including environmental risks, health impacts, biodiversity loss, and socio-economic responses. This research highlights the necessity of localized adaptation strategies, contrasting sharply with global research that overly focuses on large-scale policy and technological innovations. In Latin America, it is imperative to prioritize practical solutions that address immediate risks, such as involving local communities in disaster risk reduction efforts and effective early warning systems for extreme weather. Moreover, the study underscores the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable populations, particularly indigenous groups and rural communities. By identifying thematic trends and regional disparities, this research provides essential insights into the scientific landscape that will drive future climate change adaptation efforts in Latin America.

Assessing these experiences in specific populations allows for the identification of patterns and the implementation of preventive interventions. Objective: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the abbreviated version of the Adverse Childhood Experiences Abuse Form (ACE-ASF) in Ecuadorian youth, aiming to ensure the validity, reliability, and consistency of the instrument in accurately measuring abuse dimensions in this Ecuadorian population. Methodology: An instrumental study was conducted on the psychometric properties of the eight-item ACE-ASF, applying it to a sample of 840 university students (52.1% females and 47.9% males). The evaluation focused on analyzing the factorial structure and internal consistency of the instrument in this sample. Results: The two-factor model showed a satisfactory fit across all levels of invariance (configural, metric, scalar, and strict), with acceptable fit indices (CFI, TLI, GFI, RMSEA, and SRMR). The internal consistency was adequate, as assessed using the McDonald’s omega and Cronbach’s alpha coefficients. Convergent and discriminant validity were confirmed using the AVE and HTMT indices, ensuring proper differentiation between the dimensions assessed. Conclusion: The ACE-ASF proved to be a valid and reliable instrument for assessing abuse experiences in Ecuadorian youth. Its two-factor structure reflects distinct yet related dimensions, providing a useful tool for identifying adverse childhood experiences in this population. © 2025 by the authors.","child physical abuse; child sexual abuse; psychometrics; validation","","Universidad Politécnica Salesiana Sede Cuenca","This research was financed by the Universidad Polit\u00E9cnica Salesiana Sede Cuenca, Ecuador.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003499224"

During inspections of roofing systems, an inspector's field of vision differs from that of drones during overflights. As a result, traditional inspections might not always detect the presence and severity of stains, making maintenance on flat roofs a complex task. In this context, this experimental study aims to analyze deep learning-based semantic segmentation with images obtained from drones to map and monitor damp patches during automated building inspections of flat roof systems. The research tested two convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation: the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) with a ResNet50 backbone and DeepLabV3 with a ResNet101 backbone, as well as a transformer-based deep artificial neural network called SegFormer with a MiT-B1 backbone. We evaluated three optimizers for each model—Adam, Adagrad, and SGD—along with learning rates of 1e-2, 1e-3, and 1e-4. The models were compared using four performance metrics. The FCN, optimized with Adagrad at a learning rate of 1e-2, showed the best results.

A sandwich structure of three-substrate layers was used, considering two external substrate layers of glass (G), for the SPD sample, and of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), for the PDLC sample. The extinction coefficients, from the 4FM collimated differential equations (CDE), were decoupled into the intrinsic scattering and absorption coefficients, from the 4FM diffuse differential equations (DDE). Due to the approximated sandwich structure considered with the SPD and PDLC samples, a novel procedure was used in this work, based on four equations and four unknowns, for determining the extinction coefficients of the internal substrate active layers of the SPD and PDLC samples, in order to assure the three-extinction matching requirement. The four intuitive equations for the DDE parameters, i.e., the forward and backward average crossing parameters and the forward and backward scattering ratios of diffuse light fluxes, were used to obtain the expressions for the intrinsic scattering coefficients and for the forward and backward scattering ratios of collimated light fluxes. Finally, the parameters obtained from CDE and DDE were used in eight sets of six thickness gradient plots (for forward and backward light fluxes in the three-substrate layers), being four for SPD samples and four for PDLC, i.e., two collimated and two diffuse, for each smart windows technology, in their off and on optical states, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.","Average crossing parameter; Forward scattering ratio; Polymer dispersed liquid crystal; Scattering and absorption coefficients; Suspended particle device","Electrochromic devices; Image sensors; Light extinction; Light scattering; Liquid crystals; Optical glass; Photoelectric cells; Photolysis; Stained glass; Absorption coefficients; Average crossing parameter; Forward scattering ratio; Four-flux model; Polymer dispersed liquid crystals; Scattering and absorption; Scattering co-efficient; Scattering ratio; Suspended particle device; Suspended particles; Forward scattering","CIDETEC Centre for Electrochemical Technologies of San Sebastian; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, UC3M","The author is grateful to CIDETEC Centre for Electrochemical Technologies of San Sebastian, Spain (for providing the SPD sample), to Dreamglass company of Paracuellos del Jarama, Madrid (for providing the PDLC sample), to the Angstrom Lab of Uppsala, Sweden (for providing the used spectrometer required for measurements), and to Grupo de Displays y Aplicaciones Fot\u00F3nicas (GDAF) and to the mobility grants of Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (for supporting research in Sweden).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218625889"

This work develops a methodology that uses LiDAR (laser imaging detection and ranging) technology and roof footprints to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the rooftops in the urban centre of Santa Isabel (Azuay, Ecuador). This allowed the determination of characteristics such as area, slope, orientation, and received solar radiation, making it possible to calculate the rooftop's theoretical, technical, and economic photovoltaic potential. It was found that 68.8 % of the total roof surface is suitable for PV capture, with which a theoretical photovoltaic potential of 62.39 GWh can be achieved. The annual technical photovoltaic potential using silicon panels was calculated at 4.85 GWh, which could supply 4.97 times the demand of the analyzed neighbourhood. To determine the economic potential, the peak power of a solar project was calculated to match the electricity demand of the analysis area, with a levelized cost of energy of 12.37 c$/kWh. This project could prevent the emission of 6805 tons of CO₂ into the environment during its useful life. The methodology developed in this study can be replicated in other areas to determine their photovoltaic potential and contribute to the diversification and decentralization of electricity generation systems, as well as transform Ecuador's energy matrix. © 2024 The Authors","LiDAR technology; Solar rooftops; Urban energy self-sufficiency; Urban planning","","Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS; Universidad de Cuenca","Funding text 1: Edgar Antonio Barragan Escandon reports financial support was provided by Salesian Polytechnic University.

The objective is to propose a novel methodology for efficient fault diagnosis and intervention in the Governor system, a critical component in regulating turbine speed. Traditional diagnostic approaches often rely on manual inspection and expert intuition, and they lack formal mechanisms to model concurrent or asynchronous system behavior—leading to delays and reduced accuracy in fault identification. Our approach introduces a structured modeling technique using Petri nets, enabling dynamic analysis of the system’s behavior and response to faults. A detailed methodology was developed, beginning with a thorough characterization of the system and its translation into a Petri net model. Simulation results demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in significantly reducing diagnostic and intervention times compared to traditional methods. Results show that using Petri nets improves fault detection accuracy, accelerates decision-making, and optimizes resource allocation. This research concludes that the proposed model offers a robust framework for enhancing fault management in hydroelectric plants, providing both operational efficiency and reduced downtime. Future work will focus on integrating real-time monitoring and further validating the model in live environments to ensure scalability and adaptability to other power generation systems. © 2025 by the authors.","fault management; Governor system; hydroelectric generation; Petri net","Decision making; Electric fault currents; Fault detection; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Real time systems; Case-studies; Ecuador; Fault management; Governor system; Hydroelectric generation; Hydroelectric systems; Novel methodology; Petri net models; Power; Speed control systems; Petri nets","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008939367"

Although mammography is one of the least invasive and most widely used methods in the diagnostic process, its complexity and subjectivity in medical interpretation present significant challenges. In this article, we propose a new approach that supports the breast cancer diagnosis process by assisting in the classification of mammography images as malignant or benign, or through the BIRADS system. Our proposal consists of two phases. Initially, we implemented the FP-Growth algorithm on patients’ clinical data, analyzing variables such as age and sex to identify frequent patterns. This allows us to explore, group, and visually characterize shared findings and trends among clinical data, which is useful for doctors when creating risk groups or establishing a pre-diagnosis based on the patient’s profile. In this phase, we also prepared the images for training the different models. Subsequently, we combined the strengths of two models through stacking: the Random Forest (RF) model and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with knowledge transfer, to improve image classification and diagnosis. We also explored other methods such as CNN and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to compare the accuracy of the proposed methodology against conventional techniques. The developed models were trained using public datasets: “The Chinese Mammography Database” [2] and “The INbreast database” [3]. The accuracy of the method is evaluated using various classification-related metrics, such as Accuracy, Precision, F1 Score, and Recall. The results show that combining base models using a stacking strategy achieves significantly superior performance compared to individual models, with ideal scores in accuracy, recall, and F1 score using k-fold cross-validation in the meta-model. These excellent results suggest that combining multiple base models more effectively captures the underlying complexities and patterns in the data. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","Breast Cancer Diagnosis; Convolutional Neural Networks; Data Science; FP-Growth; Machine Learning; Medical Image Analysis; Random Forest; Support Vector Machine; Transfer Learning","Adversarial machine learning; Diseases; Lung cancer; Mammography; Oncology; Support vector machines; Transfer learning; Breast cancer diagnosis; Convolutional neural network; FP growths; Machine-learning; Medical image analysis; New approaches; Random forests; Stackings; Support vectors machine; Transfer learning; Convolutional neural networks","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210841470"

The search methodology consisted of selecting articles that centre on LM and uncertainty, and the printing industry, or another industry with similar characteristics from a quantitative perspective. The main findings are related to the identification of the applied modelling approaches and lean tools. After analysing the selected articles, the use of six modelling approaches was identified by highlighting stochastic programming (SP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The identified models aim to minimise costs, optimise production and satisfy customer demand in an uncertain environment. Using LM tools improves stability and resource efficiency and should include more of them.

The methodology combines a literature review with a quantitative assessment of 156 lubricant analysis reports from a fleet of diesel waste collection trucks operating in Cuenca, Ecuador, a high-altitude city. The framework includes critical limits for key lubricant parameters, correlation analysis, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify dominant degradation mechanisms. The Binary Segmentation (BS) algorithm is also used for Change-Point Detection. The findings indicate four primary degradation pathways: thermal–chemical degradation influenced by sulfur, oxidation, and soot; metallic wear and base depletion, involving iron, chromium, and copper; external contamination linked to silica and copper; and viscosity alteration due to lubricant aging. Significant degradation shifts were identified at approximately 346 and 444 service hours, suggesting critical points for condition-based maintenance interventions. This study highlights the effectiveness of multivariate statistical tools in enhancing the interpretation of used oil analysis and optimizing predictive maintenance strategies. The integration of Change-Point Detection and multivariate analysis provides a robust framework for defining oil change intervals based on lubricant condition rather than fixed time- or mileage-based criteria. This approach offers practical benefits for fleet operations, enabling the reduction in operational costs, enhancing engine reliability, and minimizing the environmental impact of unnecessary lubricant changes. © 2025 by the authors.","Binary Segmentation (BS); Change-Point Detection (CPD); condition monitoring; diesel engines; lubricant degradation; multivariate analysis; predictive maintenance; Principal Component Analysis (PCA); statistical correlation; used oil analysis","Effluent treatment; Image retrieval; Phase separation; Binary segmentation; Change point detection; Change-point detection; Condition; Lubricant degradation; Multi variate analysis; Oil analysis; Predictive maintenance; Principal component analyze; Principal-component analysis; Statistical correlation; Used oil; Used oil analyze; Fleet operations","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003564994"

Also, PV modules can be used to estimate irradiance through their electrical response to solar radiation using closed-form models (CFMs). This paper presents a prototype design for irradiance estimation based on evaluating three CFMs by implementing a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) system and a surface temperature measurement system. The system employs an incremental conductance (IC)-based control algorithm, which is optimized to eliminate oscillations at the maximum power point (MPP) and ensure efficient MPP tracking. Experimental validation of the implemented circuits is carried out using Arduino Nano, calibrated sensors, and low-cost electronic devices. Tests in real conditions were performed for four days under different irradiance scenarios, using two monocrystalline PV modules: one with 10 years of use and one new one. The accuracy of the CFMs was evaluated using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean squared error indicators, comparing their estimates with measurements from a Davis Instruments pyranometer. The most accurate CFM obtained a MAPE of 4.38% with the 10-year module and 3.26% with the new module. The results show that the proposed methodology provides estimates with an error of less than 5%, which validates its applicability under various climatic conditions, even with old PV modules. © 2025 by the authors.","closed-form models; estimation errors; IC algorithm; irradiance estimation; MPPT; photovoltaic modules","Surface measurement; Closed-form models; Electrical response; Estimation errors; Incremental conductance algorithm; Irradiance estimation; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Percentage error; Photovoltaic modules; Prototype designs; Solar irradiances; Temperature measurement","Universidad Nacional San Antonio Abad del Cusco; Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS","This work was funded by the Universidad Nacional San Antonio Abad del Cusco (UNSAAC) through the projects of the Professional School of Electronic Engineering and partially by the Universidad Polit\u00E9cnica Salesiana under the Fog Computing Simulation project.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003664996"

This study aims to identify and analyze the psychometric properties of the instruments used to measure perpetration and victimization in adolescent dating violence. Objective: Our objective was to identify the psychometric properties of the instruments measuring perpetration and victimization in adolescent dating violence through a systematic review of the scientific literature and meta-analysis of reliability and structural validity. Methods: The study design included a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis. The data sources used were scientific databases such as PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria were studies that evaluated the reliability and validity of instruments measuring adolescent dating violence, published in English and Spanish. Data analysis was performed through a meta-analysis to calculate reliability indices, such as Cronbach’s alpha, and structural validity was assessed using factor analysis techniques. Results: The results showed high reliability and structural validity in the instruments measuring dating violence, with high global alpha and omega coefficients and excellent model fit indices. However, heterogeneity was significant, and lower coefficients in measuring sexual violence indicated areas for improvement. Limitations include variability between studies, possible publication biases, and a lack of detailed demographic data.

Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of PNE in combination with rehabilitation modalities, with a focus on pain reduction and functional improvement. Methods: A comprehensive systematic search was conducted in Cochrane, PsycInfo, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to identify randomized clinical trials examining the effects of combining PNE with physical therapy. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction focused on demographic and methodological characteristics, as well as outcomes related to pain and disability. Results: The findings indicate that PNE combined with physical therapy significantly reduces pain intensity and enhances functionality. The mean pain score decreased from 5.89 (pre-intervention) to 3.03 (post-intervention), with similar improvements observed in disability outcomes. However, heterogeneity among studies—attributable to sociocultural and methodological differences—suggests the need for a cautious interpretation of the results. Conclusions: The integration of PNE with physical therapy appears to be an effective approach for reducing pain and improving functional outcomes in patients with chronic pain. Nevertheless, further research is recommended to address existing heterogeneity and to refine standardized intervention protocols. © 2025 by the authors.","chronic pain; meta-analysis; pain neuroscience education; physiotherapy; systematic review","analgesia; chronic pain; data base; disability; education; human; meta analysis; neuroscience; numerical cognition; pain; pain intensity; physiotherapy; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; statistical analysis; systematic review","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009107042"

Curcuma longa is a perennial species that belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which is used for therapeutic purposes due to its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, among others. This research evaluates the antibacterial activity of ethanolic and acetonic extracts of Curcuma longa against Propionibacterium acnes, recently renamed Cutibacterium acnes, that has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of acne. Secondary metabolites were identified by phytochemical screening tests. Curcuminoids determination was carried out by using TLC (thin-layer chromatography) and the phenolic compounds were quantified by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay. The antibacterial activity was evaluated using the Kirby-Bauer method with different treatments (50,75 and 100%) and broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The extracts showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, terpenoids, and tannins, confirming the presence of curcuminoids. In the quantification of phenolic compounds, no significant differences in their composition were observed. The treatment 100% of acetonic extract of Curcuma longa exhibited an inhibition percentage of 48.79% compared to the ethanolic ex tract 75% treatment, which reached 31.67%. Additionally, the acetonic extract showed a minimum inhibitory concentration of 15.62 µg/mL, while for the ethanolic extract, it was 31.25 µg/mL. These findings highlight the potential antibacterial activity of the acetonic extract against Cutibacterium acnes, which could make it a promising natural option for acne control. © The Author(s) 2025.","antibacterial activity; Curcuma longa; curcuminoids; Cutibacterium acnes","Anti-bacterial activity; Curcuma longa; Curcuminoid; Curcumum longa against propionibacteria acne; High-content; In-vitro; Minimum inhibitory concentration; Phenolic compounds; Propionibacterium acnes; Metabolites","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004664613"

By analyzing large volumes of data, LLaMA2 can detect signs of bullying that humans might miss. LLaMA2 will analyze conversations and provide detailed information about the dynamics of bullying, using comparative evaluations of data in statistical graphs. This approach reveals the prevalence and impact of bullying. The findings show specific patterns of bullying, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses for a deeper understanding of the problem. The results highlight that integrating artificial intelligence with traditional methods can improve the detection and management of bullying.

The proposal aims to determine a single distributed generator’s optimal location and sizing using the Fast Voltage Stability Index (FVSI) as the primary metric under (Formula presented.) contingency conditions. The developed strategy systematically identifies the most critical transmission lines close to instability through a frequency analysis of the FVSI in the base case and across multiple contingency scenarios. Subsequently, the weak buses associated with the most critical line are determined, on which critical load increases are simulated. The Distributed Generator (DG) sizing and location parameters are then optimized through a statistical analysis of the inflection point and the rate of change of the FVSI statistical parameters. The methodology is validated in three case studies: IEEE systems with 14, 30, and 118 buses, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness. The results show significant reductions in FVSI values and notable improvements in voltage profiles under stress and contingency conditions. For example, in the 30-bus IEEE system, the average FVSI for all contingency scenarios was reduced by 26% after applying the optimal solution. At the same time, the voltage profiles even exceeded those of the base case. This strategy represents a significant contribution, as it is capable of improving the stability of the electrical power system in all (Formula presented.) contingency scenarios with overload at critical nodes.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The research involved evaluating roads in various cities in Ecuador, including Cuenca, Riobamba, Guano, Penipe, Salcedo, and Guaranda. These roads are considered secondary, main, and urban. The SERVQUAL model was adapted to gather user perceptions on road quality through surveys, focusing on dimensions: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. Statistical analyses, including Pearson correlation coefficients, were conducted to validate the reliability and consistency of the SERVQUAL model in this context. Findings: The findings indicate that user perception, as measured by the SERVQUAL model, is a reliable metric for assessing road serviceability. Significant consistency was observed across the SERVQUAL dimensions, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in capturing user satisfaction. The study showed that user feedback provides valuable insights into road conditions, complementing technical measurements and identifying specific areas of concern that may not be evident through traditional methods alone. Conclusions: This integrated approach offers a practical and economical alternative for road serviceability assessment. It enables road management authorities to incorporate user perceptions into their evaluations, providing a more holistic view of road quality. The methodology is particularly beneficial for regions with limited resources for extensive technical evaluations. Originality/Value: This study introduces an innovative application of the SERVQUAL model in road serviceability evaluation, demonstrating the feasibility and value of using user perceptions as a complementary metric to traditional technical measurements. The approach enhances traditional evaluation methods by incorporating user feedback and reducing costs, making it valuable for road maintenance planning and decision-making. © 2025 by authors, all rights reserved.","Road Serviceability; Roads; SERVQUAL; User Perceptions; User-Centered Approach","","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002452180"

Currently, methodologies based on bibliographic data analysis are supported by information and communication technologies and have become necessary. More sophisticated processes are being used in energy systems, including new digitalization models, particularly driven by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. In the present bibliographic review, 342 documents indexed in Scopus have been identified that promote synergies between AI and the energy transition (ET), considering a time range from 1990 to 2024. The analysis methodology includes an evaluation of keywords related to the areas of AI and ET. The analyses extend to a review by authorship, co-authorship, and areas of AI’s influence in energy system subareas. The integration of energy resources, including supply and demand, in which renewable energy sources play a leading role at the end-customer level, now conceived as both producer and consumer, is intensively studied. The results identified that AI has experienced notable growth in the last five years and will undoubtedly play a leading role in the future in achieving decarbonization goals. Among the applications that it will enable will be the design of new energy markets up to the execution and start-up of new power plants with energy control and optimization. This study aims to present a baseline that allows researchers, legislators, and government decision-makers to compare their benefits, ambitions, strategies, and novel applications for formulating AI policies in the energy field. The developments and scope of AI in the energy sector were explored in relation to the AI domain in parts of the energy supply chain. While these processes involve complex data analysis, AI techniques provide powerful solutions for designing and managing energy markets with high renewable energy penetration. This integration of AI with energy systems represents a fundamental shift in market design, enabling more efficient and sustainable energy transitions. Future lines of research could focus on energy demand forecasting, dynamic adjustments in energy distribution between different generation sources, energy storage, and usage optimization. © 2025 by the authors.","artificial intelligence (AI); artificial intelligence and energy transition (AI&ET); energy planning; energy transition (ET); smart energy systems","Bibliographic retrieval systems; Bibliographies; Commerce; Energy Agency; Energy development; Supply chains; Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence and energy transition; Energy; Energy markets; Energy planning; Energy systems; Energy transition; Energy transitions; Smart energy systems; Energy transition","Universidad Católica de Cuenca, UCACUE; Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS; University of León in Spain; Universitat Politècnica de València, UPV","Daniel Icaza Alvarez, Santiago Pulla Galindo, and Carlos Flores V\u00E1zquez received the support of the Universidad Cat\u00F3lica de Cuenca in Ecuador.

Multivariate forecasting models that incorporate multiple meteorological variables improve accuracy over univariate approaches. Hyperparameter optimization and walk-forward cross-validation confirm the robustness of ET and LSTM models for wind speed prediction. What is the implication of the main finding? Incorporating diverse weather features and tuning models carefully enhances practical forecasting in complex Andean terrains. The framework offers a scalable and data-driven approach for wind-related planning in energy, infrastructure, and disaster risk contexts. The adoption of wind energy is pivotal for advancing sustainable power systems, particularly in off-grid microgrids where infrastructure limitations hinder conventional energy solutions. The inherent variability of wind generation, however, challenges grid reliability and demand–supply balance, necessitating accurate forecasting models. This study proposes a hybrid framework for short-term wind speed prediction, integrating deep learning (Long Short-Term Memory, LSTM) and ensemble methods (random forest, Extra Trees) to exploit their complementary strengths in modeling temporal dependencies. A multivariate approach is adopted using meteorological data (including wind speed, temperature, humidity, and pressure) to capture complex weather interactions through a structured time-series design. The framework also includes a feature selection stage to identify the most relevant predictors and a hyperparameter optimization process to improve model generalization. Three wind speed variables, maximum, average, and minimum, are forecasted independently to reflect intra-day variability and enhance practical usability. Validated with real-world data from Cuenca, Ecuador, the LSTM model achieves superior accuracy across all targets, demonstrating robust performance for real-world deployment. Comparative results highlight its advantage over tree-based ensemble techniques, offering actionable strategies to optimize wind energy integration, enhance grid stability, and streamline renewable resource management. These insights support the development of resilient energy systems in regions reliant on sustainable microgrid solutions. © 2025 by the authors.","deep learning; extra trees; long short-term memory; meteorological feature selection; wind forecasting","","Universidad de Las Américas Ecuador, UDLA","The APC is funded by Universidad de las Am\u00E9ricas-Ecuador.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009278816"

Random walks sampling is a crucial technique for network analysis, enabling an understanding of the network’s state irrespective of the starting node. By implementing an ACO algorithm, this research demonstrates an efficient method of sampling that ensures all nodes are sampled with uniform probability. The ACO algorithm leverages heuristic methods to significantly reduce the warm-up time required to obtain a sample. Experimental results confirm that the ACO implementation achieves the expected outcomes, demonstrating its efficiency in random sampling by reducing the number of jumps needed. This reduction in warm-up time, along with the uniform sampling capability, positions ACO as a promising alternative to traditional random walk algorithms for network analysis. The findings underscore the potential of bio-inspired algorithms in enhancing network sampling methodologies, offering both theoretical and practical implications for future research in this domain. © The Author(s) 2025.","ant colony; node sampling; random walks; small worlds","Heuristic methods; Ant colonies; Ant Colony Optimization algorithms; Colony optimization; Facebook; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Node sampling; Random Walk; S state; Small worlds; Warm-up time; Ant colony optimization","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004645026"

Understanding how students cope with these challenges is essential for developing effective support strategies. Methods: This study employed a quantitative approach with a cross-sectional descriptive-correlational design. A total of 464 university students from various academic disciplines at a higher education institution in Azogues, Ecuador, participated. Coping strategies were assessed using the Brief COPE inventory, and sociodemographic data were collected through an online form. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS software. Results: Female students most frequently used emotional support, instrumental support, and religion as coping strategies. In contrast, male students tended to rely more on substance use and positive reinterpretation. Statistically significant differences were also observed in the use of humor and according to academic level. Discussion: These findings underscore the relevance of sociodemographic factors in shaping coping strategies among university students. The study provides a foundation for targeted interventions that promote adaptive coping and enhance student well-being in higher education contexts.

Therefore, educational institutions seek to train their teachers in the use of digital tools and the generation of educational content and the creation of dynamic, effective and quality teaching environments. This study evaluates the impact of eXeLearning on the creation of interactive teaching resources in secondary education through quasi-experimental research with a quantitative approach. A set of free virtual days of teacher training was proposed, divided into three phases: training sessions, creation of learning objects with eXeLearning and presentation of good practices. The results indicate a positive perception of eXeLearning, highlighting its contribution to digital competencies, quality and efficiency in content creation. In conclusion, eXeLearning is highly accepted and potentially transformative, although it is recommended to improve its practical use in order to optimize its effectiveness in the classroom.  © 2025 IEEE.","education development; educational content creation; Learning object; professional development; teaching skills","Curricula; Engineering education; Personnel training; Professional aspects; 'current; Content creation; Education development; Educational content creation; Educational contents; Educational environment; Learning objects; Pedagogical practices; Professional development; Teaching skills; Teaching","Universidad Politecnica Salesiana in Guayaquil, (0350-011-2024-05-31)","The authors express their gratitude to the authorities of Universidad Politecnica Salesiana in Guayaquil, Ecuador, for supporting the Application of Technological Tools for Innovation in Educational Units (TIC-InnovaEdu) project, as per Resolution No. 0350-011-2024-05-31.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007412385"

The framework targets four core power quality (PQ) events defined in the IEEE 1159-2019 standard: normal operation and voltage sag, swell, and interruption. Unlike traditional methods that operate on a fixed disturbance duration, our approach incorporates multiple time scales (0.2 s, 0.4 s, and 0.8 s) to improve detection robustness across varied event lengths, a critical factor in real-world scenarios where disturbance durations are unpredictable. Features are extracted using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert spectral analysis, enabling accurate representation of the signals’ non-stationary and nonlinear characteristics. The ANN is trained using statistical descriptors derived from the first two intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), capturing both amplitude and frequency content. The method was validated in MATLAB on the IEEE 33-bus radial distribution test system using simulated disturbances. The proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of 94.09% and demonstrated consistent performance across all time windows, supporting its suitability for real-time monitoring in smart distribution networks. This study contributes a scalable and adaptable solution for automated PQ event classification under variable conditions. © 2025 by the authors.","anomaly detection; artificial neural networks; Hilbert–Huang transform; power quality; smart sensing","Anomaly detection; Classification (of information); Classifiers; Empirical mode decomposition; Hilbert-Huang transform; IEEE Standards; Power quality; Spectrum analysis; Anomaly detection; Disturbance duration; Hilbert Huang decompositions; Hilbert Huang transforms; Multiscale detection; Neural classifiers; Neural-networks; Power; Power quality event; Smart sensing; Neural networks","GIREI; Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS, (005-01-2025-02-07); Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS","Universidad Polit\u00E9cnica Salesiana and GIREI supported this work\u2014Smart Grid Research Group under the project \u201COptimization of Energy Dispatch in Block H of the Salesian Polytechnic University, Quito South Campus, through a Predictive Consumption Model and Hybrid Management between Solar Panels and the Electric Grid\u201D approved and founded by resolution 005-01-2025-02-07.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009029419"

The goal is to evaluate these tools based on six key criteria: usability, error detection efficiency, integration with other systems, technical support, cost, and flexibility. Each criterion is divided into specific sub-criteria, with weights assigned to quantify the performance of each tool. The evaluation criteria are established through an exhaustive literature review and expert consultations, and a hierarchy is organized to ensure a detailed and quantitative assessment of each tool. The results show that Testim receives the highest scores, excelling in usability, problem-solving efficiency, and technical support with a total score of 0.84. Applitools got a total of 0.82 and its best features were integration and error detection. While Selenium got the lowest score of 0.75, it is recognized for its flexibility and cost but it needs to improve its usability and technical support. This study provides an impartial framework for selecting AI-based software functional testing tools, highlighting the importance of considering multiple criteria in decision-making. The results benefit projects aiming to improve software quality by choosing the tools that best meet their needs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.","AI-based tools; Analytic Hierarchy Process; Applitools; functional; Selenium; Software testing; Testim","Decision making; Expert systems; Software quality; Usability engineering; Verification; AI-based tool; Analytic hierarchy; Applitool; Functional testing; Functionals; Hierarchy process; Software testings; Technical support; Testim; Testing tools; Software testing","Universidad Politécnica Salesiana del Ecuador, UPS","This work has been supported by the GIIAR researchgroup of the Universidad Polit\u00E9cnica Salesiana.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005828720"
